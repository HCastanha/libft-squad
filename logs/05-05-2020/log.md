A whatsapp group was created to facilitate communication and shared the personal git hub repositories with the functions developed before the squad.

We ran Libftest in all functions we had until right now in order to better organise ourselves. Then we could understand the functions that still needed to be done or tested with other tests.  

Team worked individually in functions.
