Team connected with @iwillens for help on pointer pointers to develop ft_split function

We burnt all our midnight oil finishing ft_substr, ft_strjoin and ft_split. The first 2 of them needed to be protected and the last one needed to be corrected.

Team finalized last corrections with @iwillens to submit in the repository.
