**@hcastanh ft_lst** did some of the Bonus Part (linked lists) by the morning.

**@hcastanah + @pde-carv** connected via Zoom for about 6h to develop functions from Part II; an extensive read from the official language documentation was done.
 - **ft_strjoin** was finished and tested;
 - **ft_strsplit**'s algorithm was estabilished and the function started taking form.

**@pde-carv** Ran the automated tests in the Apache Guacamole environment
 - **ft_putstr** and **ft_putstr_fd** were both changed to be protected from memory leaks.
