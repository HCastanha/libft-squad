- ft memcpy: 
*[crash]: your memcpy does not behave well with NULL as both params with size*
- ft_memccpy: 
*[fail]: your memccpy doesn't cast the memory into unsigned char*
*[fail]: your memccpy doesn't cast the stop-character into unsigned char*
- ft_memmove:
*[fail]: your memmove does not support the overlap (test 1)*
- ft_memcmp: 
*[fail]: your memcmp does not work with basic input [fail]: your memcmp does not cast the memory in unsigned char*
